# Scrabble Stems

## About

Best of Ruby Quiz, Chapter 5

In Scrabble parlance, a bingo is a play where one gets rid of all seven letters. A bingo stem is a set of six letters that combine with another letter of the alphabet to make a seven-letter word. Some six-letter stems have more possible combinations than others. For instance, one of the more prolific stems, SATIRE, combines with twenty letters: A, B, C, D, E,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,N,O,P,R,S,T,V,and W toform words such as ASTERIA, BAITERS, RACIEST, and so on.

Write a program that, given a word list and a cutoff `n`, finds all six-letter stems that combine with `n` or more distinct letters, sorted by greatest number of combinations to least.

If you need a word list to help in developing a solution, you can find [Spell Checking Oriented Word Lists (SCOWL)](http://wordlist.aspell.net/) online.
